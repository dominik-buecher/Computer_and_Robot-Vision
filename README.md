This project is about how we can localise and classify speed signs. Unlike usual, we are not relying on conventional image processing, but are training AI models that can perform these tasks independently.  The idea behind this is to split the project into two parts that can function independently of each other. 

The idea behind this is to split the project into two parts that can function independently of each other. One model is specifically trained to localise the signs in the image, while a separate model is only responsible for classification.
